 - NLP lecture: unfortunately, the slides are not public and so cannot be shared. However, the material on RNN and LSTM is completely covered in the following excellent online articles: [RNN by Karpathy](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/), and [LSTM by Olah](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/). Also, Andre discussed the recent Google Duplex project, check it out [here](https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/05/duplex-ai-system-for-natural-conversation.html).
